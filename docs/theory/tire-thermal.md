# Tire thermal ring — a reduced Farroni-TRT lumped-node model

A tire's grip, inflation pressure, and carcass stiffness all move with temperature, and temperature
moves over a stint: lap 1 is not lap 20, and a corner-heavy sequence overheats the tread while a slow
lap lets it drop out of its window. `outlap-tire`'s **thermal ring** (`crates/outlap-tire/src/thermal.rs`)
carries that state — three lumped nodes per tire, advanced segment-to-segment — so the quasi-static
(QSS) tier becomes stint-capable and the transient (T2) tier feels its tires warm up and cool down.
This is the flagship physics of milestone M5 (HANDOFF §7.2): *no open-source tire thermal model
exists in any language*, so it is implemented **clean-room from the published literature** cited below.

This page documents the ring in isolation — the model, its discretization, and the three couplings it
exposes back to the [Magic-Formula force model](mf61-steady-state.md). Wiring the ring into a lap (QSS
`march_slow_states`; T2 `SlowStack`) and adding the wear/degradation states on top of it are separate
milestone steps; here the physics is proven on its own.

## The three nodes

The ring is a lumped-parameter reduction of Farroni et al.'s *Thermo Racing Tyre* (TRT): instead of a
finite-volume mesh through the tread, it keeps the three temperatures a lap solver actually needs.

- **`T_s`** — the tread **surface**: the thin layer in contact with the road. It is the fast node,
  driven directly by the frictional sliding power and cooled by convection to the air and conduction
  to the road through the contact patch. It sets the grip.
- **`T_c`** — the tread bulk / **carcass**: the thermal mass of the tire. It is fed by hysteresis
  (the rolling-deformation loss) and exchanges heat with the surface above and the gas below. It sets
  the carcass stiffness and is the slow node that makes warm-up take laps, not seconds.
- **`T_g`** — the inflation **gas**: coupled only to the carcass; its temperature sets the hot
  inflation pressure through the ideal-gas law.

Each node obeys an energy balance (HANDOFF §7.2). Writing `G_sc, G_cg, G_road` for the solid-path
conductances (W/K) and `g_conv(v)` for the forced-convection conductance:

```
C_s·dT_s/dt = Q_fric − G_sc(T_s−T_c) − g_conv(v)·(1−a_cp)·(T_s−T_air) − G_road·a_cp·(T_s−T_road)
C_c·dT_c/dt = Q_hyst + G_sc(T_s−T_c) − G_cg(T_c−T_g)
C_g·dT_g/dt = G_cg(T_c−T_g)
```

The §7.2 rim term `−G_gr(T_g−T_rim)` is dropped: the `.tyr` schema (`TyrThermal`) carries no rim
conductance or rim temperature, so this is the reduced 3-node ring in which the gas equilibrates to
the carcass. §7.2 lists the rim as an *optional* fourth node; adding it is a schema-additive change
for later.

### Heat inputs and boundaries

- **Friction power** `Q_fric = p_t·P_slide`, where `P_slide = |Fx·v_sx| + |Fy·v_sy|` is the frictional
  sliding power at the contact patch and `p_t ≈ 0.6–0.7` is the fraction that heats the tread (the
  rest heats the road). `P_slide` comes from the current tire forces and sliding velocities; the ring
  applies `p_t`.
- **Hysteresis power** `Q_hyst = c_h·Fz·δ_tire·Ω`, the rolling-deformation loss deposited in the
  carcass. The caller forms it from the force model and passes it as a driver.
- **Convection** `g_conv(v) = (h₀ + h₁·v^0.8)·A_ext`. The `v^0.8` exponent is the turbulent-plate /
  Reynolds-number scaling of forced convection over a rolling tire; `A_ext` is the external
  (convecting) tread area. The contact-patch fraction `a_cp = A_cp/A_ext ∈ [0,1]` shields that
  fraction of the surface from the air and opens it to the road instead.
- **Boundaries** `T_air` (ambient) and `T_road` (`conditions.track_surface_C`) come from the
  conditions file.

`A_ext`, `a_cp`, `T_air`, and `T_road` are per-step **drivers**, not tire material parameters: they
depend on load, speed, and the environment, so the ring stays a pure function of
`(state, params, drivers, dt)` and carries no geometry of its own (keeping it `wasm`-clean). The
material parameters (`c_s, c_c, c_g, g_sc, g_cg, g_road, h0, h1, p_t, …`) are the `TyrThermal` block of
the `.tyr` file.

## Discretization

The ring advances with **semi-implicit Euler**: each node's own out-conductance (the diagonal decay
term) is taken implicitly, and the neighbour and boundary temperatures are held at the start-of-step
value — a Jacobi sweep. This is the shared `outlap_core::relax::semi_implicit_decay` primitive that
the battery temperature node also uses (HANDOFF §11.2):

```
x ← (x + dt·source) / (1 + dt·decay)          # decay = G_i/C_i, source = (Q_i + Σ g_ij T_j)/C_i
```

Two properties matter. It is **A-stable** in the decay term, so the coarse per-segment step of a QSS
lap (or the decimated slow clock of a T2 lap) cannot ring or overshoot — the update is a contraction
toward the instantaneous quasi-steady target. And because every node reads the start-of-step
neighbour temperatures, the sweep is **order-independent**, hence deterministic and bit-identical on
re-run (fixed-step, fixed-order, no fast-math — HANDOFF §11.2).

The discrete fixed point equals the continuous one exactly. At steady state `T_g* = T_c*` (the gas has
no external loss path) and `T_c* = T_s* + Q_hyst/G_sc` (the carcass runs hotter than the surface,
shedding its hysteresis heat upward), so the surface energy balance closes to

```
Q_fric + Q_hyst = g_conv·(1−a_cp)·(T_s*−T_air) + G_road·a_cp·(T_s*−T_road)
```

— all the heat in leaves through the surface. The property tests check this closure to round-off.

## Couplings back to the force model

The ring exposes three multipliers each step (HANDOFF §7.2). They are *computed* here; feeding them
into `SlipState` (`p`, `mu_scale_x/y`) and the carcass stiffnesses is the tier-wiring step.

1. **Gas-law pressure** — `p = p_cold · T_g/T_cold` (absolute temperatures), feeding the MF6.1 native
   inflation-pressure terms (`SlipState::p`). Hot tires run at higher pressure than their cold set
   pressure; a racing slick typically rises tens of kPa from cold to working temperature.
2. **Grip window** — `λ_μ(T_s) = exp(−c_T·((T_s−T_opt)/T_opt)²)`, a Gaussian peaking at `1` at the
   optimum temperature `T_opt` and falling off symmetrically. It scales `LMUX`/`LMUY` (isotropic; an
   asymmetric cold/hot-width option is a future extension). This is the "temperature window" every
   race engineer talks about: too cold or too hot and the tire gives up grip. The deviation is
   normalised by `T_opt` **expressed in °C** — the calibration convention the parameter is authored
   in — while the node state is stored in kelvin (SI-internal); the conversion happens only at this
   boundary.
3. **Carcass softening** — `(1 − k_c·(T_c−T_c,ref))`, scaling the carcass stiffnesses `PKX1`/`PKY1`. A
   hotter carcass is more compliant, which lowers the cornering and slip stiffness.

## Clean-room provenance

The reduced multi-node ring, the `v^0.8` forced-convection law, and the Gaussian grip window are
implemented from the published tire-thermal literature, not derived from any other codebase (game-engine
or lap-time-simulator tire code was **not** consulted as a source of derivation, per CLAUDE.md §2).

The forced-convection `h(v) = h₀ + h₁·v^n` form with `n ≈ 0.8` is the standard turbulent forced-convection
correlation (Reynolds-number scaling, e.g. the Dittus–Boelter / flat-plate family); the ideal-gas
inflation relation `p ∝ T` is elementary. The `.tyr` reference blocks that exercise this model are
**synthetic placeholders** until the FastF1 inverse-calibration lands (a later M5 step).

## Validation

![Tire thermal ring](img/tire_thermal.png)

The figure is drawn from the real `TireThermalRing` integrator (`crates/outlap-tire/examples/thermal_ring.rs`,
plotted by `python/tools/plot_tire_thermal.py`), on an F1-slick-representative synthetic parameter
set. **(a)** A cold-start warm-up: the surface node responds on a tens-of-seconds time constant
(`τ_s = C_s/G_s`), while the heavier carcass and the gas lag it — the two-timescale warm-up that makes
a stint honest, climbing into the working window over a few laps. **(b)** The three force-model
couplings swept over temperature: the grip window `λ_μ(T_s)` peaks at `T_opt`, the carcass stiffness
factor falls linearly with `T_c`, and the hot pressure `p(T_g)` rises with the gas temperature.
**(c)** The steady surface temperature against sliding-power load at two speeds — more load runs the
tire hotter, more speed convects more heat away, and the balance point lands in the working window: a
direct read of the steady-state energy closure.

Property tests (`crates/outlap-tire/tests/thermal.rs`, HANDOFF §13/§14) cover: the discrete fixed
point equal to the closed-form steady state; steady-state energy closure; the warm-up time constant
and steady surface temperature landing in the broadcast-consistent operating band for an
F1-representative set; `λ_μ ∈ (0,1]` peaking at `T_opt`; monotone convection in speed; the calibrated
gas law; carcass softening reducing stiffness; monotone warm-up; zero allocations per step; f32/f64
parity; and bit-identical determinism.
